# VirtualHub Setup

Welcome to VirtualHub Setup! Here we will setup our system in order to follow the VirtualHub tutorials.

So, what are we going to do? First we will install Kubuntu to dual-boot with Windows. You can escape this step if you are already on a Linux system. If you don’t know what Kubuntu or Linux is, don’t worry, I will explain everything.

Then we will install several software for working with the tutorials posted on [VirtualHub](https://virtualhub.eu.org).
