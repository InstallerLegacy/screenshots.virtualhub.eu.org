Welcome to VirtualHub Screenshots! Here we will post multiple screenshots of the Operating Systems and other software we install.

But, we also have screenshots on the main [VirtualHub](https://www.virtualhub.eu.org) website, so why a new site? The answer is that I am limited on the number of screenshots I can add to a tutorial while leaving it readable. A software cannot be done away with 6-7 screenshots. So, I have created this separate website to only store screenshots.

Stay tuned!
