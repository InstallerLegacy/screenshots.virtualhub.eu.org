Welcome to VirtualHub Screenshots! Here we will post multiple screenshots of the Operating Systems and other software we install.

VirtualHub Screenshots is a static site and it is fast. While [VirtualHub](https://virtualhub.eu.org) is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), this site is built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

Initially, VirtualHub was a single website, meant to complement the Legacy Installer website. You can still visit the old website here: <https://old.virtualhub.eu.org>. Now, VirtualHub is a platform of many different websites complementing each other. VirtualHub Screenshots is one of those sites.

Instead of using Windows to write the tutorials and make the videos for VirtualHub, I will use different Linux distributions. You do not need to worry about it. I have created a separate website to help you install a good Linux Distribution for beginners,  [Kubuntu](https://kubuntu.org), and also help you install the software required to follow VirtualHub tutorials on it: <https://setup.virtualhub.eu.org>. You can keep your Windows installation and dual boot. I will use Kubuntu for all the videos from now on. If you want, you can continue using Windows but the steps may need to be modified for you. For emulators and other software that do not have a Linux version or if the Linux version does not work properly, I will use [WINE](https://www.winehq.org/) to run them.

I am also introducing several other websites which will be available soon:

- [VirtualHub Blog](https://blog.virtualhub.eu.org) - The story about VirtualHub.
- [VirtualHub DOSBox-X](https://dosbox-x.virtualhub.eu.org) - Installing old software directly on DOSBox-X.
