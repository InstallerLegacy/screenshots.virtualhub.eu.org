VirtualHub Screenshots is part of VirtualHub group of websites. To learn about out other websites, see [this page](/other-websites).

We publish different screenshots of old operating systems and other software, so that you can live through the history of computing easily.

But, we also have screenshots on the main VirtualHub website, so why a new site? The answer is that I am limited in the number of screenshots I can add to a tutorial while leaving it readable. A software cannot be done away with 6-7 screenshots. So, I have created this separate website to only store screenshots.

Stay tuned!
