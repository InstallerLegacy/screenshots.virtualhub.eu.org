! Unix v4 was an operating system for the DEC PDP-11 computer. It was developed by Bell Labs. Sadly, we do not have a complete copy of Unix v4, but we do have a copy of a [kernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(operating_system)) that is from between v3 and v4. We can use that kernel with v5 [userland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_space). It can be used on SIMH PDP-11 emulator.
