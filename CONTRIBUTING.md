# How to contribute to VirtualHub Setup?

First of all thank you for showing your interest in contributing
to the VirtualHub Setup website. If you contribute to this
project, you contribute to the large effort of conserving old
software.

VirtualHub Setup is not a continuous project unlike VirtualHub
itself. It's goal is to provide instructions for setting up a
system suitable for following the VirtualHub tutorials.

So, I will probably create tutorials here myself if I think one
is needed for following my next tutorial on VirtualHub. This
means that I don't think you would want to contribute a new
tutorial to this website.

But, you may want to report errors in the existing tutorials.
You can use [Github Issues](https://github.com/InstallerLegacy/setup.virtualhub.eu.org/issues)
for that. If you now enough about Hugo to make an edit yourself
then you are welcome to fork, make the edit and open a pull
request.

There is one more possibility for you to contribute. You may have
contributed a tutorial on VirtualHub and want to add a
corresponding tutorial here. If that is the case, you should have
received an email from me containing the required instructions.
If not then please email me at [contact@virtualhub.eu.org](mailto:contact@virtualhub.eu.org).

Than You once again for showing interest in this project.
